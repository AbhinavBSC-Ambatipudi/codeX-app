# Screenshots for codeX

## How to Add Screenshots

To add real screenshots of your application to the README:

1. **Take Screenshots of Your App**:

   - Home page showing the animated logo and feature cards
   - Code editor with some sample code
   - Chatbot with a conversation example
   - Login page (optional)

2. **Image Naming**:

   - Save your screenshots with these exact names:
     - `homepage.png` - For the home page
     - `code_editor.png` - For the code editor
     - `chatbot.png` - For the AI chatbot interface

3. **Image Formatting**:

   - Use PNG format for better quality
   - Recommended resolution: 1200Ã—800 pixels or similar 16:9 aspect ratio
   - Ensure the interface is clearly visible

4. **Adding to Repository**:
   - Place the image files in this directory
   - Commit and push to your GitHub repository

The main README.md file already contains references to these images, so they will appear automatically once you add them to this directory.

## Placeholder Images

Until you add real screenshots, the README will show broken image links. This is expected and can be fixed by adding your actual screenshots.
